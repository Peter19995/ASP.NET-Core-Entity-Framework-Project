# ASP.NET Core Entity Framework Project

Welcome to the ASP.NET Core Entity Framework Project! This project is a practical demonstration of using Entity Framework Core with ASP.NET Core to build robust and efficient web applications. It covers a range of topics from basic CRUD operations to advanced database interactions.

## Project Overview

This project showcases the integration of Entity Framework Core within an ASP.NET Core application. It provides a foundation for creating web applications that leverage the power of an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework like Entity Framework Core.

## Key Concepts

### Entity Framework Core Fundamentals

Lay a strong foundation by understanding the core concepts of Entity Framework Core in the context of .NET 7 (.NET Core). Gain insights into how Entity Framework Core facilitates the interaction between your application and the underlying database, allowing you to work with data in an object-oriented manner.

### Migrations

Learn how to manage database schema changes using migrations. Migrations ensure that your application's data layer evolves seamlessly over time without manual intervention. Understand how to create, apply, and roll back migrations to keep your database schema in sync with your application's data model.

### Data Annotations

Explore the usage of data annotations to define attributes and behaviors for your data models. Data annotations provide a declarative way to specify validation rules, database column names, and other attributes related to your entities, making it easier to shape how your data is represented in the database.

### Fluent API

Dive into the Fluent API to configure and customize your data model's behavior with a higher level of control. The Fluent API allows you to define entity relationships, complex mappings, and various database-specific settings that go beyond what can be achieved with data annotations alone.

### Object Manipulation

Master the techniques for adding, updating, and removing objects within the Entity Framework Core context. Learn how to interact with your data entities using the provided APIs, enabling you to perform CRUD operations efficiently and effectively.

### Best Practices

Apply industry best practices to your Entity Framework Core usage, ensuring that your codebase remains maintainable and performant. Discover techniques for optimizing database queries, managing database connections, and structuring your application's data access layer for maximum efficiency.

### Relationships

Understand and establish relationships between entities, enabling you to model complex data structures effectively. Learn how to define and navigate relationships such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many, allowing you to represent real-world scenarios in your database design.

### Bulk Operations

Discover how to perform bulk operations efficiently using Entity Framework Core. Bulk operations allow you to insert, update, or delete multiple records in a single operation, reducing the overhead associated with individual database calls and improving performance.

### Advanced Features

Gain insights into advanced features such as change tracking, working with RAW SQL, utilizing stored procedures, views, and more. Explore how these features can enhance your data access capabilities and address specific requirements that may arise in complex applications.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get this project up and running on your local machine:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.

2. **Database Setup:** Configure your database connection string in the `appsettings.json` file. Use Entity Framework Core migrations to set up the database schema.

3. **Run the Application:** Build and run the ASP.NET Core application. The project includes sample controllers, views, and routes to demonstrate various aspects of Entity Framework Core integration.

4. **Explore the Code:** Dive into the codebase to understand how Entity Framework Core is used throughout the project. Pay special attention to data model definitions, DbContext setup, and how database operations are performed.
